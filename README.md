## Getting Started
### Clone
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Vincent-Devine/OM_Engine.git
```

### Setup Vulkan
If you don't have the Vulkan SDK installed on your PC. You can download [here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows). <br>
After installing it, **make sure** that the SDK installation has added a system variable named ```VULKAN_SDK```, which should point
directly to the SDK path.<br>
**If not**, you have two options:
1. Add the system variable manually.
2. Modify the project properties to set your path to the Vulkan SDK.
